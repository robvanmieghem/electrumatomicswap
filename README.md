# atomic swaps using Electrum wallets

[Decred atomic swaps](https://github.com/decred/atomicswap) for the electrum wallet.

This repository contains utilities to manually perform cross-chain atomic swaps
using  electrum wallets. Currently only the Bitcoin Electrum wallet is supported:

* Bitcoin ([Electrum](https://electrum.org/))

The swaps are compatible with the ones performed by the Decred swap tools.

## Roadmap

Add support for 
* Litecoin ([Electrum-ltc](https://electrum-ltc.org))

And more coins later on.
